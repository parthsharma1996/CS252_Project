The pre-registration fever is on, and which is unusually a period of intense usage of OARS website, IIT-Kanpur. This season, considered as the most disastrous failures in the history of OARS was marked down by the complete breakdown of the site, which was supposed to solve registration hassles (created by the top premier instute of India).

In an action packed week involving tearing of hair, written notes mentioning frustation, and a few broken components in our own Hall-3 Computer Centre, the real flaws in this site were exposed. While many were displeased with it, some had there own personal views. For instance Ananya Rana, (a 'worthy' candidate for Mr. Galaxy. 2016) owed his speedy recovery from anxiety to OARS. In a personal interview with our correspondent Mr. Tasnani, he was moved to tears after what seemed an impossible disease to cure.

On the other hand, a few students having nothing much to do ( well they do have assigments to complete, who cares anyways) derived their amusement from this debacle. An official page was created to vent out anger by an unofficial descendent of Mahatma Gandhi (supposedly). Our agents hav reported sighting another tall, Tinder obssessed guy, (who apparently loves nothing but Bournvita) behind this venture.  

The board of Academic Affairs were equally flabbergasted as to how could such a well programmed site, in IIT-Kanpur turn out to be such useless. "After all, only a few thousands accessed it ?", said Niraj Meeshra. A well placed source claimed it was a vendetta by the EEC, who was planning a coup in future.

Meanwhile, our prayers are with the creators of Internet Explorer (and IE as well), as its only use has gone (ofcourse apart from downloading Chrome).

On an optimistic note, Mr. Anjan went around convincing poeople that a contract for a new site has been given by the institute. Experts see this a masterstroke before the upcoming elections. 

Let's hope to have a better OARS to work with in future.
