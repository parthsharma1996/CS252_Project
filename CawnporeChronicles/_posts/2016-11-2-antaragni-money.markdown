In what can only be described as a first, Mr. Pyan Ral, an Antaragni winner from the batch of 1997 received his promised prize money of ₹300 for winning Mr. Antaragni, on this Thursday evening. Now married, with two children, he says he is delighted that he can now finally fund his children’s college education.

“I am surprised by the prompt response from the Antaragni team”, said Bhashank Shandari, sitting at his usual spot in CCD. “This institute might still have some hope left. This is a great example of the flawlessly functioning student machinery”

Meanwhile, ripples of excitement were seen across colleges in North India. Various students were quoted saying how happy they were that they might receive their promised sums within the next decade. Dr. Momesh Sathur, a leading economist remarked that this sudden start of outflow of money might help in bringing up colleges like Hansraj, who depend purely on such prize money for sustenance. “Assuming Antaragni pays back the dues it has accumulated over the last 25 years, Hansraj might get enough funds to convert itself into a minor IIT” he mused.

On being asked about the previous year’s Antaragni prize money, Mr. Bikas Vishnoi, festival coordinator of Antaragni ’15, said he had the right to remain silent, since anything that he said could be used against him in a court of law. On being told that in India neither of those rules applied and that he was watching too many Hollywood movies, he continued to remain silent, albeit with a slight frown on his face.

Sadly, this year’s Antaragni preparations seem unfazed by this development. Instead, they seem to have embraced their identity, naming this year’s mascot ‘F**k-you Panda’, a direct jab at all those naive participants who think they have any hope of winning actual prize money.

Legend has it that in the days when Antaragni was still called ‘Culfest’, winners used to be handed their winning sums by hand. Although this story has been discredited by numerous esteemed historians, modern day alumni of IIT-Kanpur continue to ply this urban myth.

Cawnpore Chronicles hopes that, with this recent development, Antaragni might progress towards this dream in the years to come.

(Antaragni 2016 will take place from Oct 20th-23rd.
This year’s Antaragni aims to be even smaller than last year’s, directly clashing with 4 other major college events and the NH7 weekender. We do hope to see you there!)
