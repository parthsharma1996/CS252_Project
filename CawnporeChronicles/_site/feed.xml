This season, considered as the most disastrous failures in the history of OARS was marked down by the complete breakdown of the site, which was supposed to solve registration hassles (created by the top premier instute of India).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In an action packed week involving tearing of hair, written notes mentioning frustation, and a few broken components in our own Hall-3 Computer Centre, the real flaws in this site were exposed. While many were displeased with it, some had there own personal views. For instance Ananya Rana, (a ‘worthy’ candidate for Mr. Galaxy. 2016) owed his speedy recovery from anxiety to OARS. In a personal interview with our correspondent Mr. Tasnani, he was moved to tears after what seemed an impossible disease to cure.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On the other hand, a few students having nothing much to do ( well they do have assigments to complete, who cares anyways) derived their amusement from this debacle. An official page was created to vent out anger by an unofficial descendent of Mahatma Gandhi (supposedly). Our agents hav reported sighting another tall, Tinder obssessed guy, (who apparently loves nothing but Bournvita) behind this venture.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The board of Academic Affairs were equally flabbergasted as to how could such a well programmed site, in IIT-Kanpur turn out to be such useless. “After all, only a few thousands accessed it ?”, said Niraj Meeshra. A well placed source claimed it was a vendetta by the EEC, who was planning a coup in future.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Meanwhile, our prayers are with the creators of Internet Explorer (and IE as well), as its only use has gone (ofcourse apart from downloading Chrome).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On an optimistic note, Mr. Anjan went around convincing poeople that a contract for a new site has been given by the institute. Experts see this a masterstroke before the upcoming elections.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Let’s hope to have a better OARS to work with in future.&lt;/p&gt;

Now married, with two children, he says he is delighted that he can now finally fund his children’s college education.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://localhost:4000/images/pyan_ral.jpeg&quot; alt=&quot;Alt text&quot; title=&quot;Pyan Ral&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“I am surprised by the prompt response from the Antaragni team”, said Bhashank Shandari, sitting at his usual spot in CCD. “This institute might still have some hope left. This is a great example of the flawlessly functioning student machinery”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Meanwhile, ripples of excitement were seen across colleges in North India. Various students were quoted saying how happy they were that they might receive their promised sums within the next decade. Dr. Momesh Sathur, a leading economist remarked that this sudden start of outflow of money might help in bringing up colleges like Hansraj, who depend purely on such prize money for sustenance. “Assuming Antaragni pays back the dues it has accumulated over the last 25 years, Hansraj might get enough funds to convert itself into a minor IIT” he mused.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On being asked about the previous year’s Antaragni prize money, Mr. Bikas Vishnoi, festival coordinator of Antaragni ’15, said he had the right to remain silent, since anything that he said could be used against him in a court of law. On being told that in India neither of those rules applied and that he was watching too many Hollywood movies, he continued to remain silent, albeit with a slight frown on his face.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Sadly, this year’s Antaragni preparations seem unfazed by this development. Instead, they seem to have embraced their identity, naming this year’s mascot ‘F**k-you Panda’, a direct jab at all those naive participants who think they have any hope of winning actual prize money.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Legend has it that in the days when Antaragni was still called ‘Culfest’, winners used to be handed their winning sums by hand. Although this story has been discredited by numerous esteemed historians, modern day alumni of IIT-Kanpur continue to ply this urban myth.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Cawnpore Chronicles hopes that, with this recent development, Antaragni might progress towards this dream in the years to come.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;(Antaragni 2016 will take place from Oct 20th-23rd.
